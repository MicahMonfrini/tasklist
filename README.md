## Takeaways:

- Recognizing which DOM elements you'll need to interact with before beginning the project is important
- Place these DOM elements into variables
- A "master" function that manages all of your event listeners is necessary
- These event listeners call the individual functions for each specific piece of functionality
	- ex: `form.addEventListener('submit', addTask);`
- `appendChild` is useful when adding items to a list
- Use `e.preventDefault();` to prevent default functionality (in forms for example)
- Always remember which element matters the most!
	- ex: Removing a task requires targeting the link element, not the `li` element
- Data stored in local storage is stored as string. Must parse when retrieving the data
	- ex: `tasks  =  JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks'));`
- Likewise, data must be converted to a string when stored in LS
	- ex: `localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));`
- You can use the `index` argument when looping through an array with `forEach()` to target specific items in an array
- Using a while loop and `.removeChild()` to clear the task list results in better performance
- Setting the `innerHTML` to an empty string uses less code and is more straight forward
- When managing input data, use `.toLowerCase()`
- `.indexOf()` is used when filtering through a list
	- ex: `if (item.toLowerCase().indexOf(text) !==  -1)`
	- -1 means the data doesn't exist 
	- !== means "not equal to"
	- Basically, this code literally says "if the input data is present". Two negatives make a positive!
